[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/EdgeNet-project/edgenet)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/EdgeNet-project/edgenet)

EdgeNet is Kubernetes adapted for the network edge. It allows you to deploy applications to hundreds of nodes 
that are scattered across the internet, rather than to just one or a small number of centralized datacenters.

The code that we are developing here is in production powering [the EdgeNet testbed](http://www.edge-net.org/),
on which researchers worldwide conduct experiments in distributed systems and internet measurements.

## Contributing

We invite you to contribute to this free open-source software (FOSS) initiative.

Please take a look at our [project backlog](https://github.com/orgs/EdgeNet-project/projects/2) to see if 
there are issues that interest you. Or suggest your own.

We are currently rolling out new code on a two week cycle. Take a look at our current sprint in the list of
[milestones](https://github.com/EdgeNet-project/edgenet/milestones) to see what we are working on now.

## Repository layout

If you are familiar with the [Standard Go Project Layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout) used
