EdgeNet is Kubernetes adapted for the network edge. It allows you to deploy applications to hundreds of nodes
that are scattered across the internet, rather than to just one or a small number of centralized datacenters.

The code that we are developing here is in production powering [the EdgeNet testbed](https://www.edge-net.org/),
on which researchers worldwide conduct experiments in distributed systems and internet measurements.

## Contributing

The EdgeNet software is free and open source; we invite you to contribute.

To get a sense of where we are heading, please see our list of
[milestones](https://github.com/EdgeNet-project/edgenet/milestones).
We follow an agile development approach, with two week sprints, each one leading to a new production version of the
code. Our current sprint is one of the milestones, and you can see more near-term issues in our
[project backlog](https://github.com/orgs/EdgeNet-project/projects/2).
You can pick one of these to work on, or suggest your own.

To start work, clone the latest release branch. When you have something you would like us to look at,
please create a pull request for @bsenel to review.

## Repository layout

If you are familiar with the [Standard Go Project Layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout) used
