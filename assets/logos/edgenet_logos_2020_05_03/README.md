**This is the May 3rd 2020 version of the EdgeNet logos.**

There is a rectangular logo including both logomark and logotype:

<img src="edgenet_logo_2020_05_03_w_text_075dpi.png" height="100"/>

And a square logo consisting only of the logomark:

<img src="edgenet_logo_2020_05_03_no_text_075dpi.png" height="100"/>

The logomark colors are black, white, and blue #5785DC. The logotype font is [Ubuntu Bold 700](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ubuntu?sidebar.open&selection.family=Ubuntu:wght@700) in blue #3C6EDD. The color codes are as specified in the master file, though they might be rendered slightly differently on your screen.

The master file for creating the logos is an OmniGraffle file, though the SVG files should work just as well if you do not have the OmniGraffle application.

Both logos are available here in PNG and PDF versions with transparent background.
