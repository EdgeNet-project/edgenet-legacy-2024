# EdgeNet documentation

This is where we develop documentation for EdgeNet, the Kubernetes-based edge cloud software that
powers the [EdgeNet testbed](http://www.edge-net.org/), providing dozens of nodes at the internet's
edge to distributed systems and network measurement researchers worldwide.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to EdgeNet of any kind, including documentation, suggestions, bug reports,
pull requests, etc. You are in the right place for documentation-related contributions.
<!-- Also check out our [contribution guide](). --> 

Spelling fixes are most welcomed, as are contributions and edits to longer sections of the documentation.

## Branches

* The `master` branch reflects the currently-deployed version of EdgeNet.
* The current `release` branch is where we prepare the next EdgeNet release. Please make your changes to this branch.
