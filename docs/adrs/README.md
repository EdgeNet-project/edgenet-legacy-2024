# Architecture Decision Records
The [Architecture Decision Records](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2072/paper9.pdf) (ADRs) hold significant value in documenting crucial decisions related to the architecture of EdgeNet. These records serve as a comprehensive repository, capturing the rationale, considerations, and outcomes of important architectural choices made throughout the development and evolution of the EdgeNet system.

These records serve as a valuable resource for the EdgeNet community, allowing them to learn from past decisions, evaluate the impact of architectural choices, and contribute to ongoing discussions or future improvements. They also promote collaboration and facilitate effective communication among team members, ensuring that architectural decisions are well-documented and widely understood.
