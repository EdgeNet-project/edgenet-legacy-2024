# Contribution Guidelines

## Contribution
We welcome contributions to EdgeNet of any kind, including documentation, suggestions, bug reports, pull requests, etc. Spelling fixes are most welcomed, as are contributions and edits to longer sections of the documentation.

You can start how open-source works from this [guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#how-to-submit-a-contribution).

We follow a similar workflow for issues and pull requests as Kubernetes. You can have a more detailed description [here](https://www.kubernetes.dev/docs/guide/pull-requests/).
