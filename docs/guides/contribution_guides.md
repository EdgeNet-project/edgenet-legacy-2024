# Contribution 

## Contribution to EdgeNet Project
We welcome contributions to EdgeNet of any kind, including documentation, suggestions, bug reports, pull requests, etc. Spelling fixes are most welcomed, as are contributions and edits to longer sections of the documentation.

For more info, you can see [how open-source works](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#how-to-submit-a-contribution). Additionally, please make sure you read the [Kubernetes contribution cheat sheet](https://www.kubernetes.dev/docs/contributor-cheatsheet/).

1. Getting Started

    Familiarize yourself with EdgeNet's purpose, goals, and existing codebase by reading the documentation and browsing the source code. 

    Follow the project's documentation to set up your development environment. Ensure that you have the required programming languages, libraries, and tools installed and configured properly. Test your setup by building and running the project locally to ensure it works as expected.

2. Finding an Issue or Feature to Work On

    Explore the EdgeNet's [issue tracker](https://github.com/EdgeNet-project/edgenet/issues), [planned features board](https://github.com/orgs/EdgeNet-project/projects/4/views/1), and [backlog](https://github.com/orgs/EdgeNet-project/projects/5) to find issues or features that align with your interests and skills. Look for issues tagged as "good first issue" or "help wanted" to find tasks suitable for newcomers. If you have a new idea or want to propose a feature, open a new issue or discuss it with the project maintainer [@bsenel](https://github.com/bsenel) to gather feedback and ensure it aligns with the project's goals. 

3. Contributing Code

    Fork the project repository to your GitHub account. Create a new branch for your work, preferably named after the feature or issue you're addressing. Write clean, readable, and well-documented code that adheres to the project's coding style and guidelines. You can find the go style guide [here](https://google.github.io/styleguide/go/). Include [unit tests](unit_test_guides.md) for your code additions or modifications to ensure its correctness and maintainability. Make frequent, small commits with clear commit messages that describe the changes made. Regularly pull the latest changes from the upstream repository to keep your branch up to date.

4. Submitting a Pull Request

    Ensure that your code passes all tests and doesn't introduce any regressions. Update the project's documentation if necessary to reflect your changes. Write a clear and concise pull request description that explains the problem solved or the feature implemented. Include any relevant information, screenshots, or examples that help reviewers understand your changes. Submit the pull request and await feedback from the project maintainer [@bsenel](https://github.com/bsenel) and community members. 

    We follow a similar workflow for issues and pull requests as Kubernetes. You can have a more detailed description [here](https://www.kubernetes.dev/docs/guide/pull-requests/). 

5. Code Review and Iteration

    Be open to feedback and constructive criticism from reviewers. Respond to comments promptly, addressing any concerns or questions raised. Make necessary changes or improvements based on the feedback received. Engage in discussions with the reviewers to clarify any ambiguities or suggest alternative solutions. Follow the project's review process and guidelines for incorporating changes into your code.

6. Communication and Collaboration

    Engage with the EdgeNet community by participating in discussions, answering questions, and helping fellow contributors. Follow EdgeNet's communication channels and respond to notifications promptly. Respect the opinions and viewpoints of others, fostering a positive and inclusive community environment.

## Conclusion
Contributing to EdgeNet provides opportunities for learning, collaboration, making a positive impact, and understanding Kubernetes better. By following these guides and engaging with the project's community, you can become a valuable contributor and help shape the future of the project.
