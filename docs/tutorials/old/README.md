# Tutorials
This is a folder for EdgeNet tutorials that are delivered at conferences and other venues. The goal is to make it easy to stand up a tutorial, and have both materials and necessary software available.  Each tutorial should be in a separate directory, with a README file describing the tutorial and associated files and instructions for both presenters and tutorial-takers.

There is a tension between making it easy for tutorial-takers to download instantly-usable YAML files, etc., without dependencies on desktop software and portability of a tutorial -- hardcoded server names in YAML files, etc.  We've come down on the side of ease-of-use, which means frequent updates to the repo for each tutorial.  Make a note of what you've changed and why.
