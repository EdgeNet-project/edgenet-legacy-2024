# Hello, World
This is a Hello, World tutorial, first used at the MERIF workshop May 30, 2019.  In this tutorial, students create a Daemon Set which calls a server (must be stood up) with a simple greeting.  The server can dump the hellos it's heard in either plaintext or JSON format
There are two directories here: server, which contains a simple flask server, and a client, which contains a simple YAML file used for deployment.
Both server and client have hardcoded stuff which should be put into variables, particularly on the server side.  On the server side, the list of sites is hardcoded: this should be pulled down in JSON from the portal.  On the client side, the URL of the server is hardcoded -- because the alternative otherwise is to take time in the tutorial for the students to edit it.
