# Hello, World Server
This is a simple flask server.  There are no external files and no dependencies other than the obvious -- Python and Flask must be installed on the system, and it must obviously have an open port.  This has been tested with:
Python 2.7.12
Flask 1.0.3
Werkzeug 0.15.4
The sitenames are hardcoded; these should instead be gotten from a call to the portal on boot (which will be put in, and then this should be modified).
