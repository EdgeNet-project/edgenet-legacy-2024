# Registering an EdgeNet tenant

This tutorial describes whether and how you can set up a *tenant* on EdgeNet, with yourself as the tenant owner. A tenant owner takes responsibility for the approval of EdgeNet users whom they can vouch for.

Authorizations to use EdgeNet are handed out hierarchically, establishing a chain of responsibility. We, as the central administrators of EdgeNet, approve the establishment of tenants and their owners. An owner, in turn, approves the creation of individual user accounts. The owner can give some of those users administrative rights to, in turn, approve other users.

Our job is to ensure that only bona fide researchers can create and run local tenants. If you wish to create a tenant, please be sure to register with your institutional e-mail address, and please direct us to an institutional website or provide other evidence of your role. In general, we approve faculty members at institutions of higher education and senior researchers at research centers, but we will consider other cases as well.

A local tenant owner also approves the creation of *subsidiary namespaces*, which allows sharing of tenant resource quota with a group of users. And an owner manages, either directly or through a user to whom they delegate this role, any *nodes* that are contributed on behalf of the tenant to the EdgeNet cluster.

If you believe that you may be eligible to act as the local owner of a tenant, the remainder of this tutorial guides you through the registration process.

If you would like to use EdgeNet but do not believe that you can act as a local owner, we encourage you to identify someone at your institution who is already an owner, or who would be willing to register as one.

### A note on terminology for PlanetLab users

For those of you familiar with PlanetLab, a tenant is similar to a *site* and a local tenant owner is similar to a *PI*.

## Technologies you will use

You will use [``kubectl``](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/), the [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) command-line interface.

In order to obtain your user-specific kubeconfig file, you need to take yourself to the [landing application](https://landing.edge-net.org). 
This application also provides a user interface design to facilitate the process.
In this case, you no longer need to follow these instructions as it provides you with a classical registration procedure.

## What you will do

You will authenticate yourself through the landing application to obtain your kubeconfig file from the landing application.
Using this kubeconfig file, you will create a *tenant request* object that is associated with your e-mail address. 
This will alert the central administrators of EdgeNet, who will if all is in order, approve your request. 
With approval, your tenant is prepared to allow you to act as both the local owner and a user of your tenant.

## Steps

### Make sure you have the Kubernetes command-line tool

If you do not already have ``kubectl``, you will need to install it on your system. Follow the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) for this.

### Obtain your access credential

An EdgeNet tenant request is a Kubernetes object, and to manipulate objects on a Kubernetes system you need a kubeconfig file.

You can fetch your kubeconfig file here: [https://landing.edge-net.org](https://landing.edge-net.org). In what follows, we will assume that it is saved in your working directory on your system as ``./edgenet.cfg``.

Default permissions do not allow any actions beyond the creation of a tenant/role/cluster role request. Once the request goes through, you can start using EdgeNet as the local owner and a user of your tenant.

### Prepare a description of your tenant

The [``.yaml`` format](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/kubernetes-objects/) is used to describe Kubernetes objects. Create one for the tenant request object, following the model of the example shown below. Your ``.yaml``file must specify the following information regarding your future tenant:
- the **tenant name** that will be used by the EdgeNet system; it must follow [Kubernetes' rules for names](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/) and must be different from any existing EdgeNet tenant names
- the **full name** of the tenant, which is a human-readable name
- the **short name** of the tenant, which is also human-readable, and can be the same as the full name, or a shorter name, in case the full name is long
- the **URL** of the tenant; this should be a web page from your institution that confirms your role as a bona fide researcher
- the **postal address** of the tenant; the information provided for this person consists of:
  - a **street** address
  - a **ZIP** code/postal code
  - a **city** name
  - a **region**, or state name (not mandatory)
  - a **country** name
- the **contact person** who is responsible for this tenant; this is the tenant's first administrator, who is typically yourself; the information provided for this person consists of:
  - a **first name** (human readable)
  - a **last name** (human readable)
  - an **e-mail address**, which should be an institutional e-mail address
  - a **phone number**, which should be in quotation marks, start with the country code using the plus notation, and not contain any spaces or other formatting
- the **cluster network policy** that will be used to isolate your pod network from other tenants, which is a boolean
- the **resource allocation** that will be used to assign an overall quota, called tenant resource quota, that encompasses all tenant's namespaces; resources here must be compatible with [Kubernetes resource types](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#resource-types)

In what follows, we will assume that this file is saved in your working directory on your system as ``./tenantrequest.yaml``.

Example:
```yaml
apiVersion: registration.edgenet.io/v1alpha1
kind: TenantRequest
metadata:
  name: lip6-lab
spec:
  fullname: Laboratoire LIP6-CNRS
  shortname: lip6
  url: https://www.lip6.fr/recherche/team_membres.php?acronyme=NPA
  address:
    street: 4 place Jussieu, boite 169
    zip: "75005"
    city: Paris
    region: ÃŽle-de-France
    country: France
  contact:
    firstname: Timur
    lastname: Friedman
    email: timur.friedman@sorbonne-universite.fr
    phone: "+33123456789"
  clusternetworkpolicy: true
  resourceallocation:
    cpu: "12000m"
    memory: "12Gi"
```

### Create your tenant request

You will be unable to change the name of a tenant request after creating it. Before continuing, ensure that your file is correct. A non-approved request will be deleted after 72 hours. Once that is done, you can use the same name again.

Using ``kubectl``, create a tenant request object:

```
kubectl create -f ./tenantrequest.yaml --kubeconfig ./edgenet.cfg
```

### Wait for approval and enjoy your tenant

At this point, the EdgeNet central administrators will, if needed, contact you, and, provided everything is in order, approve your role request. Upon approval, you will receive an email that confirms that your registration is complete and contains your tenant and user information.

You can now start using EdgeNet, as both administrators of your local tenant and as a regular user, with your user-specific kubeconfig file.
