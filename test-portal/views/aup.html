  <h1>Edge-net Acceptable Use Policy</h1>
</center>
  <p>
    EdgeNet is an overlay testbed designed to allow researchers to 
experiment with network applications and services that benefit from 
distribution across a wide geographic area. All uses of EdgeNet should 
be consistent with this high-level goal.

   </p>
   <h2>Guidelines</h2>
   <p>
    As an overlay, EdgeNet is not a &quot;testbed&quot; in the usual sense
of a controlled environment for experiments. It consists of computational 
resources hosted by organizations (principally research organizations 
like Universities) that donate virtual machines and network 
connectivity for the good of the community. Running an experiment on 
EdgeNet is fundamentally different from running it in a LAN-based lab 
or on an isolated wide-area testbed.
  </p>
  <p>
A good litmus test when considering whether an experiment is 
appropriate for EdgeNet is to ask what the network administrator at 
your organization would say about the experiment running on your local 
site. If the experiment disrupts local activity (e.g., uses more than 
its share of your site's Internet bandwidth) or triggers complaints 
from remote network administrators (e.g., performs systematic port 
scans), then it is not appropriate for EdgeNet. It is your 
responsibility to ensure that your use of EdgeNet falls within these 
constraints. This means you should debug your code in a controlled 
environment so you have confidence that you understand its behavior.
EdgeNet is also designed to allow experimental services to run 
continuously, thereby supporting an end-user community. As a 
consequence, EdgeNet could indirectly support users that have not 
officially registered with EdgeNet, and may even be unknown to you (the 
service provider). It is your responsibility to ensure that your users 
do not cause your service to violate the terms of this AUP.  In 
particular, service providers should ensure that their users are not 
able to hijack the service and use it to attack or spam other nodes or 
network users.
</p>
  <p>
Among its many uses, EdgeNet is designed to support network measurement 
experiments that purposely probe the Internet. However, we expect all 
users to adhere to widely-accepted standards of network etiquette in an 
effort to minimize complaints from network administrators. Activities 
that have been interpreted as worm and denial-of-service attacks in the 
past (and should be avoided) include sending SYN packets to port 80 on 
random machines, probing random IP addresses, repeatedly pinging 
routers, overloading bottleneck links with measurement traffic, and 
probing a single target machine from many EdgeNet nodes.
</p>
  <p>
It is likely that individual sites that host EdgeNet nodes will have 
their own AUPs. Users should not knowingly violate such local AUPs. 
Conflicts between site AUPs and EdgeNet's stated goal of supporting 
research into wide-area networks should be brought to the attention of 
EdgeNet administrators. The expectations placed on sites that host 
EdgeNet nodes are described in a companion document: Hosting a EdgeNet 
Node.
</p>
  <p>
While the central EdgeNet authority is often the first point-of-contact 
for complaints about misbehaving services, it is our policy to put the 
complainant in direct contact with the researcher that is responsible 
for the service.
EdgeNet provides absolutely no privacy guarantees with regard to 
network. In fact, users should assume packets will be monitored and 
logged, for example, to allow other users and EdgeNet administrators to 
investigate abuse (see previous paragraph).
EdgeNet also does not provide any guarantees with respect to the 
reliability of individual nodes, which may be rebooted or reinstalled 
any time. Reinstalling a node implies that the disk is wiped, meaning 
that users should not treat the local disk as a persistent form of 
storage.
</p>
<h2>Overall Rules</h2>
<p> EdgeNet should not be used for any illegal or commercial 
activities. Use for research and educational purposes is allowed.</p>
<h2>Node Usage Rules</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Use existing security mechanisms. For example, all access to 
EdgeNet nodes must be via SSH or the Kubernetes dashboard.</li>
  <li> Do not circumvent accounting and auditing mechanisms. This means 
you must associate your identity with the EdgeNet namespace (account) 
in which your service runs, and you must not do anything to obfuscate 
the audit trail.</li>
  <li> No hacking attempts of the EdgeNet nodes. This includes &quot;red 
team&quot; (hacker test) experiments. All access is non-root.</li>
  <li>Avoid spin-wait for extended periods of time. If possible, do not 
spin-wait at all.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Network Usage Rules</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Do not use your EdgeNet slice (account) to gain access to 
hosting site resources other than the EdgeNet resources at the 
site.</li>
  <li>Do not use one or more EdgeNet nodes to flood a site with so much 
traffic as to interfere with its normal operation. Use congestion 
controlled flows for large transfers.</li>
  <li>Do not do systematic or random port or address block scans. Do 
not spoof or sniff traffic.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Consequences</h2>
<p>Violations of this AUP may result in any of the following:
<ul><li>disabling the namespace (account);</li>
  <li>removing the site from EdgeNet;/li>
  <li>informing the organization's administration</li>
</ul>
<p>To report a suspected violation of this policy, contact EdgeNet 
Support</p>
