                EdgeNet is an open source project to contribute back to the Kubernetes community.
                The backend, an extension of the Kubernetes API, is an API written in Go that is
                open to those who have auth. It gets the benefit of client-go and Go packages for
                talking to the Kubernetes API of EdgeNet and makes use of the Namecheap API and
                the GeoLite2 database. You are very welcome to contribute our community! Let's

                Kubernetes is a well-known and an open-source system for the orchestration of containerized
                applications. More explicitly, Kubernetes automates deployments, and it also scales and manages
                containerized applications across a cluster. Originally, Kubernetes appears itself as a solution
                for cloud infrastructure, but, there is a strong community who wants to bring it to Edge.
                And, EdgeNet is one of the players to do so by building itself up on Kubernetes.

              <p class="text">
                Thanks to containerization technology, it easier to build and deploy applications across
                servers in a way that is a reliable and scalable way. It also provides us an opportunity
                to avoid setting up an operating system per application. Briefly, Docker is a platform to
                build, manage, and secure applications and also to may deploy them. EdgeNet users make
                use of Docker containers to pack and deploy their applications.

              <p class="text">
                EdgeNet is yet to focus on Device Edge, so the devices, such as smartphones, laptops, and sensors, that really
                have limited spare compute and data storage capability with connectivity problems. Distinct from infrastructure
                edge as device edge uses device resources, whereas infrastructure edge uses edge nodes such as individual servers
                or other sets of computing resources. So, EdgeNet has established a Kubernetes edge cluster that the edge nodes,
                with cloud-like capabilities are located in distributed locations at infrastructure edge. Moreover, EdgeNet makes
                it easy for third parties to add, to contribute nodes into EdgeNet cluster in the way Kubernetes users do by using
                <b>.YAML</b> configuration files. In addition to this, EdgeNet presents Selective Deployment that provides ability of
                deploying applications based on the node geolocation.

                Selective Deployment allows users to deploy containerized applications to a widely distributed set of nodes
                by choosing the nodes by their locations. Users can do so based on continents, countries, states/regions,
                and cities, as well as polygons describes using latitudes and longitudes. Please <a href="./features.html">click here</a>

                where PlanetLab nodes are located, whereas a authority in EdgeNet is not required to provide a node. But, they both own
                users and slices, additionally, authorities in EdgeNet have an added feature called Team inherited from

                The central admins of EdgeNet approve the establishment of authorities, each authority having its own local authority admins called an authority-admin,
                so local admin. An authority-admin approves the creation of individual user accounts. Authority-admins can delegate user approval,
                creation of teams and slices to managers. And by giving a tech role can make a user be responsible for nodes
                that are contributed to the EdgeNet cluster. And a user is anyone who develops and deploys applications on EdgeNet.
                A slice is a set of allocated resources distributed across PlanetLab, and to most users, a slice means UNIX shell
                access to certain PlanetLab nodes, whereas a slice means a set of allocated resources on the cluster in EdgeNet.
                As a final one, Team groups users to give them permission to create slices independently.

                to reach higher numbers in wider area by having your contributions. Because of this, we have developed a feature
                that makes it easy to add a node in EdgeNet cluster. In this way, with your contributions, EdgeNet would offer
                more vantage points to users for doing experiments in a widely-spread cluster.

                    <li><b>Abstract:</b> <i>EdgeNet is the prototype of a scalable, sustainable general-purpose testbed for very wide area distributed
                      systems and extremely low-latency distributed services. In this, it is aimed at the same experimenters and systems that formed
                      the core usage of previous, highly-successful wide-area testbeds such as PlanetLab [1], G-Lab [2], V-Node [5], GENI [4], and
                      SAVI [3], and it incorporates many of the features that characterized those previous testbeds. EdgeNet's goal is to achieve
                      the usability and research value of the previous generations of wide area testbed, whilst offering radical improvements in the
                      scalability and sustainability of those systems. It achieves this scalability and sustainability through a strategy of using
                      industry-standard open-source software as the basis of its software stack, and by a strategy of hardwarefree, bottom-up,
                      site-driven deployment. EdgeNet follows the Seattle [6] and PlanetIgnite [9] strategy of permitting sites to join the testbed
                      with purely local action.</i></li>

                    <li><b>Abstract:</b> <i>We describe the deployment of an Internet measurement experiment to three testbeds that offer
                      Linux containers hosted at widely distributed vantage points: the well-established PlanetLab Central and PlanetLab Europe
                      platforms, and the new EdgeNet platform. The experiment results were published in the proceedings of ACM IMC 2018.
                      We compare the capabilities of each testbed and their effect on the ease of deployment of the experiment. Because
                      the software for this experiment has several library dependencies and requires a recent compiler, it was easiest
                      to deploy on EdgeNet, which is based on Docker and Kubernetes. This extended abstract is accompanied by a demonstration
                      of the reproducible deployment of a measurement tool on EdgeNet.</i></li>

                    <li><b>Abstract:</b> <i>EdgeNet has been informed by the advances of cloud computing and the successes of such
                      distributed systems as PlanetLab, GENI, G-Lab, SAVI, and V-Node: a large number of small points-of-presence,
                      designed for the deployment of highly distributed experiments and applications. EdgeNet differs from its
                      predecessors in two significant areas: first, it is a software-only infrastructure, where each worker node
                      is designed to run part-or full-time on existing hardware at the local site; and, second, it uses modern,
                      industry-standard software both as the node agent and the control framework. The first innovation permits
                      rapid and unlimited scaling: whereas GENI and PlanetLab required the installation and maintenance of dedicated
                      hardware at each site, EdgeNet requires only a software download, and a node can be added to the EdgeNet
                      infrastructure in 15 minutes. The second offers performance, maintenance, and training benefits; rather than
                      maintaining bespoke kernels and control frameworks, and developing training materials on using the latter,
                      we are able to ride the wave of open-source and industry development, and the plethora of industry and community
                      tutorial materials developed for industry standard control frameworks. The result is a global Kubernetes cluster,
                      where pods of Docker containers form the service instances at each point of presence.</i></li>
