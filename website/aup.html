              <h1>EdgeNet Acceptable Use Policy</h1>
              <p>
                EdgeNet is an overlay testbed designed to allow researchers to
                experiment with network applications and services that benefit
                from distribution across a wide geographic area. All uses of EdgeNet
                should be consistent with this high-level goal.
              </p>
              <h2>Guidelines</h2>
              <p>
                As an overlay, EdgeNet is not a "testbed" in the usual sense
                of a controlled environment for experiments. It consists of
                computational resources hosted by organizations (principally research
                institutions like universities) and individuals that donate virtual
                machines and network connectivity for the good of the community.
                Running an experiment on EdgeNet is fundamentally different from running
                it in a LAN-based lab or on an isolated wide-area testbed.
              </p>
              <p>
                A good litmus test when considering whether an experiment is
                appropriate for EdgeNet is to ask what the network administrator
                at your institution would say about the experiment running there.
                If the experiment disrupts local activity (e.g., uses more than
                its share of your institution's Internet bandwidth) or triggers
                complaints from remote network administrators (e.g., performs systematic
                port scans), then it is not appropriate for EdgeNet. It is your
                responsibility to ensure that your use of EdgeNet falls within
                these constraints. This means that you should debug your code in a
                controlled environment so that you have confidence that you understand its
                behavior. EdgeNet is also designed to allow experimental services to run
                continuously, thereby supporting an end-user community. As a
                consequence, EdgeNet could indirectly support users that have
                not officially registered with EdgeNet, and may even be unknown to
                you (the service provider). It is your responsibility to ensure that your
                users do not cause your service to violate the terms of this AUP. In
                particular, service providers should ensure that their users are
                not able to hijack the service and use it to attack or spam other
                nodes or network users.
              </p>
              <p>
                Among its many uses, EdgeNet is designed to support network
                measurement experiments that purposely probe the Internet. However, we
                expect all users to adhere to widely-accepted standards of network
                etiquette in an effort to minimize complaints from network administrators.
                Activities that have been interpreted as worm and denial-of-service attacks
                in the past (and should be undertaken only with considerable caution)
                include sending SYN packets to port 80 on random machines, probing random
                IP addresses, repeatedly pinging routers, overloading bottleneck links with
                measurement traffic, and probing a single target machine from many EdgeNet nodes.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is likely that institutional hosts of EdgeNet nodes will have
                their own AUPs. Users should not knowingly violate such local
                AUPs. Conflicts between site AUPs and EdgeNet's stated goal of
                supporting research into wide-area networks should be brought to the
                attention of EdgeNet administrators.
              </p>
              <p>
                While the central EdgeNet authority is often the first point-of-contact
                for complaints about misbehaving services, it is our policy to
                put the complainant in direct contact with the researcher who is
                responsible for the service. EdgeNet provides absolutely no privacy
                guarantees with regards to the network. In fact, users should assume
                that packets will be monitored and logged, for example, to allow other
                users and EdgeNet administrators to investigate abuse (see previous paragraph).
                EdgeNet also does not provide any guarantees with respect to the
                reliability of individual nodes, which may be rebooted or reinstalled
                at any time. Reinstalling a node implies that its local storage
                is wiped, meaning that users should not treat it as a persistent
                form of storage.
              </p>
              <h2>Overall Rules</h2>
              <p>
                EdgeNet should not be used for any illegal or commercial activities.
                Use for research and educational purposes is allowed.
              </p>
              <h2>Node Usage Rules</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>Use existing security mechanisms. For example, all access to
                  EdgeNet nodes should be via standard Kubernetes mechanisms,
                  such as <code>kubectl</code> or the dashboard. You may also
                  enable SSH access to the containers that you deploy, and
                  access them in that way.</li>
                <li>Do not circumvent accounting and auditing mechanisms. This
                  means that you must associate your persona identity with your
                  EdgeNet account, and you must not do anything to obfuscate any
                  audit trail.</li>
                <li>You may not engage in hacking of EdgeNet nodes. This includes
                  "red team" (hacker test) experiments. All access is non-root.</li>
                <li>Avoid spin-wait for extended periods of time. If possible,
                  do not spin-wait at all.</li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Network Usage Rules</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>Do not use your EdgeNet account to gain access to host node
                  resources other than your own EdgeNet containers.</li>
                <li>Do not use one or more EdgeNet nodes to flood a site with so
                  much traffic as to interfere with its normal operation. Use
                  congestion controlled flows for large transfers.</li>
                <li>Do not conduct systematic or random port or address block
                  scans, source address spoofing, or sniffing of traffic,
                  without first having your methodology cleared by the EdgeNet
                  administrators.</li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Consequences</h2>
              <p>Violations of this AUP may result in any of the following:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>disabling of your account</li>
                <li>disabling of the local authority that granted you your account</li>
                <li>informing your institution's administration</li>
              </ul>
              <p>If you have any questions, or to report a suspected violation
                of this policy, please contact EdgeNet
                Support at <a href="mailto:edgenet-support@planet-lab.eu">edgenet-support@planet-lab.eu</a>.
