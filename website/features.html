                If you know how to use Kubernetes, you know how to use EdgeNet. Since EdgeNet is built on Kubernetes, you drive it via the
                familiar kubectl command line tool, or the Kubernetes dashboard web interface. These tools have been augmented with the
                EdgeNet-specific extensions that are detailed below.
              </p>
              <h2>Selective Deployment</h2>
              <hr>
              <p class="text-small-margin">
                EdgeNet’s value as compared to vanilla Kubernetes is its ability to deploy containerized software to a widely distributed
                set of nodes rather than to nodes that are all grouped together in a centralized datacenter. As an EdgeNet user you want
                to choose your nodes based upon their locations. We give you the opportunity to do so based on continent, country,
                state/region, and city, as well as on polygons that you describe using latitudes and longitudes. Further development
                will increase your possibilities; please let us know what is important for you!
              </p>
              <p class="text-small-margin">
                <img class="image-wrap-text-right max-width-400" alt="Selective Deployment" src="img/selective-deployment.jpg">
                As a Kubernetes user, you are already comfortable with creating, updating, and deleting its DaemonSet, Deployment, and
                StatefulSet API resources so as to schedule Pods to a cluster’s nodes. If you create a DaemonSet then your Pods will
                run on all available nodes of the cluster, whereas with a Deployment or a StatefulSet, your Pods will run on as many
                nodes of the cluster as Kubernetes judges best, based upon its assessment of container resource consumption and
                available node resources, whereas. Whichever controller you choose in vanilla Kubernetes, you are indifferent to
                which nodes run your Pods, as they are all located in a centralized datacenter. But when you deploy to the edge cloud,
                you want to select nodes at particular locations for your Pods. Through EdgeNet, you can select those nodes by defining
                a subcluster. For instance, a DaemonSet defined as having five nodes in Germany and four in France will ensure that
                your Pods are deployed to nine nodes that meet those criteria.
              </p>
              <p class="text-small-margin">
                The SelectiveDeployments CRD, as a namespaced API resource, enables deployments based on geolocations. The system
                basically reconfigures the native Kubernetes controllers, which are DaemonSet, Deployment, and StatefulSet, to
                fulfill its task.
              </p>
              <p class="text-small-margin add-bottom-margin">
                When a selective deployment object is created, the controller adjusts node affinities of DaemonSets, Deployments,
                or StatefulSets existed in that object to establish deployment of applications according to the geolocations defined.
                The system searches the latitude & longitude information of nodes in a GeoIP database to pick up the nodes and
                set node affinities.

              <h2>Authorities</h2>

              <p class="text-small-margin">

                Authorizations to use EdgeNet are handed out hierarchically, so that local administrators approve local users who they know.
                The central administrators of EdgeNet approve the establishment of authorities, each authority having its own local authority administrator
                called an authority-admin. An authority-admin, in turn, approves the creation of individual user accounts. Authority-admins also approve
                the creation of teams, which group users. And the authority-admins may be responsible for nodes that are contributed to
                the EdgeNet cluster. Authority Operations in EdgeNet consist of two Custom Resource Definitions; AuthorityRequests,
                and Authorities. Those allow us to enable user roles that we desired in Kubernetes. You could find the details of each below.
                There is a public endpoint, can be interacted using public kubeconfig file, for the requests of authority and user registrations.
              </p>
              <p class="text-small-margin">
                The Authority CRD, as a non-namespaced API resource, enables establishing the user role models that we desired and designed
                in Kubernetes. Thereby, a user group with a hierarchy of authority responsibility can use EdgeNet under the roof of a authority.
                Moreover, a authority hosts the teams that allow the users of that authority to create slices freely, and the slices that users
                can deploy their applications, by the respect of resource quota constraints of that slice, towards the EdgeNet cluster.
              </p>
              <p class="text-small-margin">
                Only cluster admins and authority requests approved by cluster admins may create a authority object in EdgeNet.
                To create a authority, no other users are allowed or there is no other way. When a authority is created, an authority-admin user is created based
                on the Authority's contact information.
              </p>
              <h3>Authority Requests</h3>
              <p class="text-small-margin add-bottom-margin">
                The AuthorityRequests CRD, as a non-namespaced API resource, provides a public endpoint to allow making authority
                registration requests independently. A user who wishes to register his authority at EdgeNet can do that directly by using
                the EdgeNet Portal or by kubectl with an EdgeNet public kubeconfig file that can be obtained by requesting the portal
                to a valid email address.
              </p>
              <p class="text-small-margin">
                The controller behind this custom resource automatically removes the registration request after 72 hours if the
                registration request is not approved by a cluster-admin. When a authority request object is created, the system sends
                an email verification object to the contact of that authority. Cluster-admins are not notified until the email is verified.
                In case of a cluster-admin approves a authority request, the controller creates a authority object according to the
                authority request which gets deleted after.
              </p>
              <p class="text-small-margin">
                <b>But, how it works?</b><br/>
                When a registration request has been made, EdgeNet sends an email including a one-time code for the email verification
                of that user. That is to avoid struggling with fake registration requests. At this point, there is no notification
                reaches to the email address of the EdgeNet cluster admin. Then, authority-admins verified their email address, need to be done in
                24 hours, by using the one-time codes they received.
              </p>
              <p class="text-small-margin">
                This is the time the cluster-admin needs to take action that is approving the request before 72 hours in total passed
                away. Because the admin gets a notification about the authority requests since authority-admin verified the email address.
                In the next steps, the authority request controller creates a authority object according to request data. And, when
                a authority is created in EdgeNet, the authority controller generates a namespace by combining the authority name and the string of
                “authority” as a prefix, then sets a resource quota in it to prevent deploying applications in this namespace, and creates an
                authority-admin user. Herewith, the authority controller sends a notification that says your authority creation is successful while the user controller
                creates a service account dedicated to the user and generates a kubeconfig file to deliver it along with the user
                information by email. Authority-admin can now start using EdgeNet with the user-specific kubeconfig file, which means authority-admin is ready
                to welcome user registration requests on the authority.
              </p>

                The User CRD, as a namespaced API resource, assigns service accounts to users and delivers kubeconfig file that
                generated according to that service account. The system attaches role bindings to service account based on their user
                roles to fulfill desired user role models. Thereby, a user can do actions that correspond to the user role in Kubernetes.
                Only cluster admins or authority-admins(s) of that authority and user registration requests approved by a cluster-admin or an authority-admin or
                a manager of that authority may create a user object in EdgeNet. To create a user, no other users are allowed or there is no
                other way. Authority-admin can change user roles after user object is created.
              </p>
              <h3>User Registration Requests</h3>
              <p class="text-small-margin">
                The UserRegistrationRequests CRD, as a namespaced API resource, provides a public endpoint to allow making user
                registration requests to authorities independently. A user who wishes to register himself to a authority at EdgeNet can do that
                directly by using the EdgeNet Portal or by kubectl with an EdgeNet public kubeconfig file that can be obtained by
                requesting the portal to a valid email address. The user registration request only covers the regular user role.
              </p>
              <p class="text-small-margin">
                The controller behind this custom resource automatically removes the registration request after 72 hours if the
                registration request is not approved by a cluster-admin or an authority-admin or a manager of that authority. When a user registration
                object is created, the system sends an email verification object. The authority-admin(s) and manager(s) are not notified until
                the email is verified. When a user registration request gets approved, the controller creates a user object according
                to the user registration request which gets deleted after.
              </p>
              <p class="text-small-margin add-bottom-margin">
                Likely authority-admins have been done, but with a difference, users make registration requests on authorities that already registered
                in EdgeNet. And again EdgeNet has the same procedure about email verification to prevent fake requests on the authorities
                that would be boring for authority-admins if EdgeNet informs them about all requests without email verification. As authority-admins receive
                the kubeconfig file by email, the user controller delivers the user information along with a kubeconfig file to the
                user's email address. So, users can now start using EdgeNet as well. But, the authority namespace is not a workspace which
                users collaborate with.

              <p class="text-small-margin">
                When a team object is created, the controller crafts a namespace that provides general authorization to create slices
                on it. Thereby, any participant of a team can create a slice freely. Additionally, the authority-admin(s) and manager(s) of the
                authority on which team created and the participants of the team get their invitations by email containing team

                authority-a-team-a as you can see at the top middle of this slide. But,  it is not allowed to deploy applications in a team
                namespace either. However, a team namespace authorizes users who participate in, to create slices in the team
